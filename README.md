# ama_tu_salud

Ama Tu Salud is a personal health organizer allowing patients to keep track of there blood sugar levels and medications.

For those having to take care of a family member who is diabetic.  I can relate with the struggle of having to keep up with journals,
innacurate logs from glucometers, staying up to date on medications and the importance of having an organized log of blood sugar level readings for the Doctor to review.  Having a one stop resource you can have anywere with you on the go will be valuable.
